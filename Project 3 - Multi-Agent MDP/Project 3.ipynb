    "The invader/defender problem is an example task where one agent tries to invade a territory, while the other agent tries to defend it. The task is defined as follows:\n",
    "- Time is broken up into discrete epochs.\n",
    "- The world is a square area that is broken up into a 6-by-6 grid of cells.\n",
    "- There are two players or agents; both of them can move up, down, left, or right. At each time step, both players take their action simultaneously. Each cannot see the others' action at that time step, but the state of the  system and previous actions are fully observable to each. If the chosen action takes an agent outside of the grid, then the agent remains in the current position.\n",
    "- The invader, marked I, starts in the upper-left corner of the world. The defender, marked D, starts in the bottom-left corner of the world.\n",
    "- The 9 cells centered around the defender's current position (see Figure 1), is the region where the invader will be captured. The game ends whenever the invader is captured by the defender, or the invader enters the fixed territory cell marked T, whichever comes first.\n",
    "- The goal of the defender is to capture the invader as far away as possible from the territory T. The goal of the invader is to move as close as possible to the territory T before being captured.\n",

    "Now that you have worked out how to compute the minimax equilibrium, you are ready to implement the value iteration algorithm. Create a python class in a file called ValueIteration.py with the following routines:\n",

    "- A procedure that initializes the value function(s) V to zero for all states. Whether you have one value function in total, or one for each agent, depends on your answer to 1(a). If you have one, it may be defined for the defender or invader, but please be consistent in defining all your other variables.\n",
    "- A function that takes the current game state s and actions from both agents a1, a2 and computes the return, e.g. Q(vector_s, (a1, a2)).\n",
    "- A function that takes the current game state s and computes a payoff matrix, where the entries are Q(vector_s, (a1, a2)) indexed by a1 and a2.\n",
    "- A function that takes an arbitrary payoff matrix Q, formulates the LP for each agent and solves it. This function should return the optimal objective value(s) of the final solution, followed by the minimax equilibria for defender and for the invader. To solve the LP using the simplex method, you should use the function linprog from the scipy.optimize package. The LP formulations you obtained in the form of 1(d) will make it easy for you to define the appropriate arguments to call the linprog function. Make sure that you read documentation about this function before calling it (there are some nuances, for example make sure to specify correct bounds on the variables as a tuple of pairs (x_lb, x_ub) for each variable).\n",

    "- A procedure for plotting the final value function(s) as a 2D heatmap. Here, you need to create two plots. The first plot shows the final value function from the invader's perspective as a function of the invader's starting position, when the defender starting position is fixed at x = 0; y = 5. Similarly, the second plot shows the final value function from the defender's perspective as a function of the defender's starting position when the invader's starting position is fixed at x = 0; y = 0.\n",
    "- A procedure for the main loop of the value iteration algorithm. This procedure should be responsible for initializing the value function(s), performing the iterations to update the value function(s), and monitoring convergence. Your algorithm should stop as soon as the delta, the maximum absolute change in the value function between iteration k - 1 and iteration k is less than 1e-6. At the end of this procedure, you should plot the delta value at each iteration as a line plot. You should also plot the final value functions as heatmaps as described in the previous bullet point.\n",
